# Burning Barbell
Burning Barbell is a company we created that creates apps. The app that we have created is a personal fitness app. This app is used by users
to do many different things. Like calculate their Body Mass Index or calculate how much water they need to consume daily, or something we
are most proud of is to log their calories. The user if they have any questions can head over to the contact portion of the app to either email,
call, or text our company email and phone. You are also able to find us via google maps or scheduele an appointment.
